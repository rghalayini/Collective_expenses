# Collective_expenses

This is a tool to calculate the expenses in a household where multiple people live and contribute to all expenses together. In theory, everybody can buy whatever food they want and all expenses will be shared equally among all residents. Each person will pay according to the time spent at home during the counting period. This means that if somebody was away for few nights, they will not pay the food expenses for the time in which they were away. The amoung that they payed at the grocery will be taken into account as well.
